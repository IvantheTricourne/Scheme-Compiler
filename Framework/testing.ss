;;
;; Adapated for P423 Spring 2012 by Claire Alvis and Chris Frisz
;;
;; This testing framework will run the tests found in (Framework
;; test-suite) over any compiler exported in (Compiler compile).
;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; To run a test suite:
;; (test-valid)    runs all the valid tests
;; (test-invalid)  runs all the invalid tests
;; (test-all)      runs all the tests
;; (run-tests)
;;    runs the compiler in (test-compiler) over the tests in
;;    (test-suite) with a fresh test runner. if you've customized
;;    anything, use this to run your customizations.
;;
;; Debugging:
;; After you run a test suite, you may use the following procedures
;; to recover what went wrong with the tests that failed.
;;
;; (display-test-failure <test number>)
;;    returns a description of the test's error condition
;;
;; (inspect (test-failure-condition <test number>))
;;    this enters the scheme debugger with the error condition
;;    so you can inspect it
;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Customizations:
;;
;; (test-suite <new-test-suite>)
;;    Creates a test-suite from the list of test cases specified by
;;    <new-test-suite>
;; (refine-test-suite <test-number>*)
;;    Reduces the current test suite to those specified by the
;;    <test-number>* set. Note that this causes original numbering to
;;    be lost.
;;
;; (test-compiler <new-test-compiler>)
;;    Specifies which compiler is to be used. This is generally
;;    defined by the (Compiler compile) library.
;;
;; (reset-test-runner)
;;    Resets the current test runner to a fresh test runner,
;;    discarding all the information from the previous run of the test
;;    suite
